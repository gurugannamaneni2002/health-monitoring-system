# INTRODUCTION
 This repository is about the Processing-based system featuring user signup/sign-in, real-time visualization of pulse
waveforms from a serial port, and storing data in a MySQL database for health monitoring .And sending
the information through telegram to mobile phones 

# Aurdino IDE
First we have implemented a bread board level circuit(wired connections) using heart rate sensors(MAX 30102),ESP32 and a Multiplexer(TCA9548A)(to connect the sensors at different addresses).

Then using ARDUINO IDE we have simulated the waveforms of the wrist pulse from three different positions(vaata,pitta,kapha).

Next, by using wifi protocol in ESP32 we demostrated a simple and basic waveform visualisation  using python gui.
